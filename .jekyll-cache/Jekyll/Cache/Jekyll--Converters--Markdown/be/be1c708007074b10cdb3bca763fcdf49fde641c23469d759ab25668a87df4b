Autonomous done navigation is getting attention in different fields during last years. Applications focused on people-rescue, surveillance, infrastructure inspection are being demanded nowadays, but drone must be operated autonomously by itself.

<br />
The focus of the study is on Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV), whose use covers
from rescues in inaccessible areas, to inspections in the industry, or
inventoried, among many other examples.In parallel, we have the study of the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum, which
covers a large part of the modern world, such as the use of communications
mobile phones, or in broadcasting using frequency bands such as FM radio. Thus,
Understanding and working on signal propagation can introduce us to new
useful applications for the world.


<br />
<br />

To evaluate properly this project, a FRISS model has been implemented in python and create a ROS node to export this feature to the ROS ecosystem. Check the PDF above for more information.

<br />
<br />

The objective of this work is to developed a solution based on reinfocemente learning (Q-learning) that is able to learn how to reach a RF transmmiter at outdoor/indoor environment. Static and dynamic environments have been evaluated with obstácules in a realistic way.
