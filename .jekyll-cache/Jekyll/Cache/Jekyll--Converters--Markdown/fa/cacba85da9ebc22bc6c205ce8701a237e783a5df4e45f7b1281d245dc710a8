I"`	<p>I’m a PhD candidate at <a href="https://www.urjc.es/">Universidad Rey Juan Carlos</a>, Madrid, researching artificial intelligence, computer vision and robotics and its application to autonomous driving.
I obtained an Informatics Engineering and Software Engineering Dual Degree at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos and a 
MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid with a José Cuena award.</p>

<p>The projects I’m working on now can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/sergiopaniego">GitHub account</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to research, I’m also a teaching assistant for some courses (Artificial Intelligence and Robotics) for third-year students at the same uni related to my research interests. 
I have also developed a course for <a href="https://platzi.com/">Platzi</a> platform called <a href="https://platzi.com/cursos/tensorflow-objetos/">Object Detection and Segmentation with Tensorflow</a> among others (<a href="/teaching">teaching section</a>).
I also like to give <a href="/teaching">talks</a> about my work and artificial intelligence in general.</p>

<p>I have participated in <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> program six years in a row. 
The first one was in <a href="https://jderobot.github.io/activities/gsoc/2018">2018</a> as a Student Intern working with <a href="https://jderobot.github.io/">JdeRobot Robotics and Artificial Intelligence association</a> and 
the following  five as a mentor in several artificial intelligence related projects, <a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/DetectionStudio">Detection Studio</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/BehaviorStudio">Behavior Studio</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/DeepLearningStudio/">Deep Learning Studio</a> with the same association, where I still collaborate. 
These projects and others have led to <a href="/publications">publications</a>.</p>
