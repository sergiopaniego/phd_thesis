<br />
The automotive world does not escape the advances of robotics and AI. one of the great dreams in the history of humanity
Since cars circulate in our world, autonomous cars are becoming increasingly popular every day
closer to being a reality. In some countries, autonomous cars are already going circulate through large cities, even doing taxi services.


The world of autonomous driving is also related to the racing motorsport, with the existence of some competitions in which one
one of the most important elements, if not the most, of a racing car, which is the
pilot is not a person but a computer capable of understanding and analyzing the
car environment to drive himself as fast as possible around track.

<br />
<br />

This TFG focuses on the development of autonomous driving behaviors
based on reinforcement learning in racing circuits, in order to obtain
reactive and appropriate behaviors in different scenarios using
a robot with the necessary characteristics to carry out these behaviors,
the AWS Deepracer.

<br />
The AWS Deepracer league is a competition where participants try to build an autonomous behavior
 in a small racing car using artificial intelligence. In this
competition, participants are provided with a small robot with
autonomous capabilities, the AWS Deepracer promoted by Amazon, together with a simulated environment
in which the participants must program the robot with one goal: be the fastast one!
