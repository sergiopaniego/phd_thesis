Artificial intelligence is already helping in the education field to understand the needs of each student and improve the learning methodologies for a better education.
Neural networks such as PoseNet or FaceMesh can help to understand the dynamic of the class without expose the student's privacy. In collaboration with <b><a href="https://tknika.eus/">Tknika</a></b> a deep learning vision-based framework has been developed to detect and analyze emotions, behaviours, movements and talk-action of the students in a regular class.

This work focuses on developing a system for detecting and analyzing emotions
and behaviors based on AI on a teaching environment. Main goal of the project is to
provide useful information to teachers about student performance. This system
detection is based on algorithms that have been designed to perform a visual analysis of images and videos using pose and face neural networks for emotion detection. After all the analysis the information obtained is adapted to use as a guide and help for teachers, who will be able to understand visually the different events that occurred during a class in relation to a certain students.

Privacy has been treated as a central pillar in this project, that's why no images are saved, neither audio of the environment is analyzed.
